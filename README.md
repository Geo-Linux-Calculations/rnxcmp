## Description
RNXCMP is the software for compression/restoration of RINEX observation files developed by Y. Hatanaka of GSI.
It converts the foramt of GNSS observation files from the RINEX format (version 2.xx or 3.xx) to a compressed
format (the CompactRINEX format, or often called the Hatanaka-compressed format) and vice versa.
This format is frequently used to exchange GNSS observation data through internet.

The source codes, binaries compiled for several OS types,
and some texts can be downloaded by clicking the following items.
Use of this service is subject to read and follow the README.txt
